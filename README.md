Sun Ray Server
--------------

I used the scripts and package files here to successfully install SRS 5.2 on Ubuntu Linux 11.04 i386 circa 2014. Hopefully this can help someone, as when setting this up I ran into issues with broken links due to the age of the software and what it requires. This is only exasperated by the decade which has passed since this repo was created.

I used a combination of these tutorials and reference materials to get the system installed:
* SRS 5.2 installation zip (V26743-01.zip)
  * original source: http://www.mittag-leffler.se/~koponen/sunray/5.2_oracle/
  * now available via the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/sunray-server-3.x-4.x-5.x

I would recommend staying on Ubuntu 11.04 and GDM 2.20, as I haven't heard of any successful installs on later versions.
